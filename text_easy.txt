The morning sun shines softly,  
warming the cool breeze that moves through the trees.  
Birds fly across the open sky,  
welcoming another calm day.

The gentle sound of waves fills the air,  
as the sand glows golden beneath the sunlight.  
Children build castles by the shore,  
their laughter carried by the wind.

A cat sleeps quietly on the porch,  
its tail twitching with every dream.  
The air smells of rain and fresh leaves,  
and the world feels still.

The candle flickers near the window,  
its flame dancing in the quiet room.  
Outside, stars shimmer softly,  
and the night hums in peace.

###PARA
The park is filled with blooming flowers,  
and bees hum between the petals.  
The sky is bright and clear,  
inviting everyone to smile.

###PARA
Leaves rustle gently in the wind,  
as footsteps echo down the quiet lane.  
A new day begins with soft light,  
and endless possibilities.

###PARA
The river flows beneath the bridge,  
sparkling like glass in the sunlight.  
A boy tosses a pebble,  
watching the ripples fade away.
