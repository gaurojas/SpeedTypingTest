“Wait for me!” she shouted,  
her voice fading in the fog.  
The streetlight flickered once,  
and then went dark.

a steady rhythm against the silence.  
He sipped his tea slowly,  
lost in a thought that refused to end.

listening to its heavy tick-tock.  
“Do you remember?” he asked,

its echo cutting through the night.

closing the dusty book.  
The clock struck twelve,  
and the candle burned lower.

then watched it disappear with the rain.  
Some memories, he thought,  
fade just as easily.
